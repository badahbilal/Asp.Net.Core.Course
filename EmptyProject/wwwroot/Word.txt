Now, we're also going to be taking a look at  Swangard that comes with the dot net five template,  but for ease of use and to speed us up as we test our  different methods and endpoints that we create in

And the experience is roughly identical. 

And nowadays in the year, twenty twenty one is  actually a pretty good code editor. 

And it's a very lightweight editor and I personally  work a lot faster in US code than I do in Visual

So this lesson is only aimed at those of you that are  actually going to use visual studio code to develop your application and as I mentioned, 
if you've not  used it or you've been away for some time, but 

And it's significantly more lightweight than Visual  Studio. 

But your first troubleshooting step with Visual Studio  Code is if something's not working. 

The one that I have installed by Joss Creative is one  that is maintained and is functional with the 

and it will give us the scaffolding for a C sharp class  or interface. 

So what I would recommend you do is you come in  and bookmark the git repository for this particular project, so you've always got something to refer to.
